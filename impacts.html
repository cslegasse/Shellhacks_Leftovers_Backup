    <h1>Impacts of Food Waste</h1>
    <p>Food waste is often overlooked as a cause of climate change, but its role should not be overlooked as it makes up 8% of total emissions. Every year in the United States, food wasted is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enough to feed more than 150 million people per year</li>
        <li>Grown on an area the size of California and New York combined</li>
        <li>Produced by enough power and water for more than 50 million American homes</li>
        <li>Grown by over 750 million pounds of pesticides</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One third of all food produced in the U.S. goes uneaten, and it is largely caused by the disposal of leftovers. Research has shown that leftover food is statistically not likely to be eaten and will make it into the garbage. One of the major reasons is people simply forget about the food before it spoils. Our tool is designed to help remind people of their leftover food so it does not go to waste.</p>
